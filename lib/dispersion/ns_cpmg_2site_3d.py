"""The numerical fit of 2-site Bloch-McConnell equations for CPMG-type experiments, the U{NS CPMG 2-site 3D<http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/NS_CPMG_2-site_3D>} and U{NS CPMG 2-site 3D full<http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/NS_CPMG_2-site_3D_full>} models.

Description
===========

The function uses an explicit matrix that contains relaxation, exchange and chemical shift terms.  It does the 180deg pulses in the CPMG train.  The approach of Bloch-McConnell can be found in chapter 3.1 of Palmer, A. G. Chem Rev 2004, 104, 3623-3640.  This function was written, initially in MATLAB, in 2010.


Code origin
===========

This is the model of the numerical solution for the 2-site Bloch-McConnell equations.  It originates as optimization function number 1 from the fitting_main_kex.py script from Mathilde Lescanne, Paul Schanda, and Dominique Marion (see U{http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.nmr.relax.devel/4138}, U{https://gna.org/task/?7712#comment2} and U{https://gna.org/support/download.php?file_id=18262}).
