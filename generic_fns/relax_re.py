    This method converts from relax's RE syntax to that of the re python module.

    The changes include:

        1.  All '*' to '.*'.
        2.  The identifier is bracketed, '^' is added to the start and '$' to the end.

    After conversion of both the string and patterns, the comparison is then performed both ways from the converted string matching the original string (using re.search()).
