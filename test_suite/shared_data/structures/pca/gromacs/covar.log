Program: g_covar
Working directory: /data/edau/relax/git/relax-trunk/test_suite/shared_data/structures/pca/gromacs

Read 5 frames from ../distribution.pdb (time 1 to 5 ps)

Analysis group is 'System' (75 atoms)
No fit was used
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 225x225 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 0.434933
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 0.434933

Wrote 225 eigenvalues to eigenval.xvg
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and eigenvec.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 4 to eigenvec.trr
