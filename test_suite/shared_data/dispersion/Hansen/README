The directories contain the data recorded using the improved pulse sequence with 1H CW decoupling during the CPMG period.

The original format was different and was modified to better suit the way relax handles datasets.

The files ending in '_sparky' include both the intensities and chemical shifts for each residue and are formatted similarly to 'Sparky' peak lists.
