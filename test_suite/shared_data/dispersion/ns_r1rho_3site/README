The data in this directory has been generated using Dmitry Korzhnev's cpmg_fit program.

First, generate the blank cpmg_fit input data with:

$ python generate_blanks.py

Then run cpmg_fit with:

$ cpmg_fit < back_calculate.cpmg_fit

Finally split up the 'all.res' output file with:

$ python split_all.py

Note that a high precision version of cpmg_fit has been used to output the values with more decimal places.
