Testing
=======

Compile the C modules for the major line (trunk) by typing:

$ scons

and then run the test suite on all possible architectures to make sure the release is ready.



Tagging
=======

Make a copy of the current head to the tags directory using a command such as:

$ svn cp -F svn_msg svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/trunk svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/2.0.1

In the commit message file 'svn_msg', have a header line which says 'relax version 2.0.1.', followed by a short description of the release.

Checkout the tagged version with:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/2.0.1



Version number
==============

Change the version number in file 'version.py' and commit the change.



PDF manual
==========

Build the PDF version of the relax user manual by typing:

$ scons user_manual_pdf

then add the manual to the repository:

$ svn add docs/relax.pdf

and commit all the changes.  Clean up the temporary files with:

$ scons clean

Copy the PDF manual to the mirror directory for the relax download site for uploading in one of the steps below.



CHANGES file
============

Review the SVN logs and add an entry into the CHANGES file (in the 'docs/' directory) for the current release.  Create three sections titled 'Features', 'Changes', and 'Bugfixes'.  The 'devel_scripts/log_converter.py' script can be used to generate the documentation, which will need major editing (the starting revision is from the CHANGES merge of the previous release):

$ svn log -v -r18314:HEAD > log
$ ./devel_scripts/log_converter.py log > log_formatted

The result should be modified and every line checked.  Bugs should be in the 'Bugfixes' section only if it affects previous relax releases, otherwise it should be in the 'Changes' section.  The following should be removed:  minor, insignificant, and unidentifiable changes such as "Import fix." (this is highly subjective); all exclamation marks; message IDs for mailing list posts; svnmerge commits; the messages of all reverted commits; all revision numbers such as 'r19899' or the word 'revision'; the names and email addresses of committers or patch providers; and all email addresses.  Spelling should be checked and proper punctuation used throughout, including two spaces after a period.  Missing spaces after punctuation due to the log_converter.py script need to be corrected.  Commit the changes.  Port the revision back into the main line.



Distribution files
==================

Package bundling
----------------

Bundle minfx and bmrblib by checking out the latest stable release tags, for example:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.10/minfx
$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/bmrblib/tags/1.0.3/bmrblib


Source files
------------

Generate the source distribution files (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ scons source_dist key=xxxxx

where xxxxx is the name of your GPG key.


Binary files
------------

Generate the binary distribution files for each platform (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ scons binary_dist key=xxxxx


Signing
-------

If the key is not supplied, or incorrectly supplied, the distribution file will be created but not signed.  To sign the file later, type:

$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxxxx relax-2.0.1.GNU-Linux.x86_64.tar.bz2


Other files
-----------

Build other distribution packages by checking out the tag and bundling minfx and bmrblib:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/2.0.1
$ cd 2.0.1
$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.10/minfx
$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/bmrblib/tags/1.0.3/bmrblib
$ scons binary_dist key=xxxxx

Or:

$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/2.0.1
$ cd 2.0.1
$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.10/minfx
$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/bmrblib/tags/1.0.3/bmrblib
$ scons binary_dist



Upload
======

Move the distribution files and their signatures to the mirror directory for the relax download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'http://download.gna.org/relax/'.  First make sure the mirror directory contains all of the files so that the next command does not accidentally delete files:

$ rsync -av --progress --no-perms --rsh="ssh" bugman@download.gna.org:/upload/relax/ .

Then rsync the entire directory contents to download.gna.org/upload/relax/ using the command:

$ rsync --delete -av --progress --no-perms --partial --rsh="ssh" . bugman@download.gna.org:/upload/relax/

The upload script simplifies the upload process:

$ ./upload



Website
=======

Downloads
---------

Modify the http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html webpage to point to the newest version of relax.  Update the MD5 checksums and file sizes on the download page.  Commit the updates.


Manual
------

Create the HTML version of the manual with the command:

$ scons user_manual_html

Replace the old manual with the new in the http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual SVN repository (http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/relax/website) and commit the new manual.


API documentation
-----------------

Create the API documentation for the current version with the command:

$ scons api_manual_html

Replace the old API documentation in the http://www.nmr-relax.com/api SVN repository (http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/relax/website), update the api/index.html file and commit the new files.  If a new minor version is being released, create a new directory such as api/3.1/, copy the files there, and then edit the api/index.html file to add the new version.



Gna!
====

Add the version number to the bug tracker field 'Release' at https://gna.org/bugs/admin/field_values.php?group=relax.



FSF directory
=============

Update the version number in the FSF directory (http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Relax).



Announcement
============

Post the release message to the relax-announce mailing list and as a news item on the relax Gna! website.


Mailing list
------------

On the relax-announce mailing list, write a detailed and full description of the release.  Also add a paragraph with links for downloading the release.  At the end, add a section titled 'The full list of changes is:' and cut and paste the part of the CHANGES file for this release.  Include links to the trackers in the full list of changes.


Gna! news item
--------------

For the news item, firstly cut and paste the mailing list message.  Item references such as bug #7641, task #3122, etc. are automatically converted into links.  Create three sections using the Savane markup (recipe #236).  Call these = Description =, = Download =, and = Full list of changes =.  For the last section, use the subtitles == Features == ,  == Changes == , and  == Bugfixes ==.  The items in this section start with '* ' to create an unnumbered list.  Strip all leading whitespace from the full list of changes and remove all the links to the trackers (as these will be automatically created).
