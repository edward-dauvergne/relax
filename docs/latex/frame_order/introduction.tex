\subsection{Tensors of frame ordering}

The frame order theory is a new analysis type designed for studying the rigid body motions of molecules.
It provides a bridge between statistical mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) models and all rotational molecular physics techniques, by defining a series of rank-$2n$ frame order tensors.
These tensors define the maximum information content of a rotational molecular physics experiment, as well as what type of information is contained in the data.
To use the frame order theory, two steps are required:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The physics of the experiment should be decomposed into statistically mechanically averaged product of rotation matrix elements.
\item The MD model should be expressed in terms of a rotation matrix which modulates the motion of the rigid body, within the reference frame matching that of the experimental data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ln$^{3+}$ aligned RDC and PCS data}

For the current implementation in relax, the frame order theory has been derived for molecules internally aligned using paramagnetic lanthanide ions.
The data required for the analysis includes both residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and pseudocontact shifts (PCSs).
Both data sets are required as they are complementary, each carrying different dynamics information:
\begin{description}
\item[RDCs:]  This data is dominated by the amplitudes of the MD motions, and the orientation of the statical mechanical average structure.
\item[PCSs:]  These mainly provide information about the directions of the MD motions, and the orientation and position of the statical mechanical average structure.
\end{description}

For a successful analysis, the data must be of the highest quality.
In addition, multiple alignments are required, either using different lanthanide ions and/or a different attachment point for the lanthanide ion.
Note that the current implementation only handles alignment of one rigid body or domain.
